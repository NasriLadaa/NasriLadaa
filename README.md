# Hi there, I'm Nasri Ladaa! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Senior Full Stack Developer with a keen interest in web development, mobile applcation development, data science, and open-source contributions. Here, you'll find a variety of projects that I've worked on, ranging from small utilities to more complex applications.

## 🔭 Projects
-  **[Master's Thesis: Machine Learning & Deep Learning Experiments](https://github.com/NasriLadaa/Thesis_Experiments_2023_SWEN_Nasri)**: Conducted a series of experiments applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to solve real-world problems.
-  **[Dataset Classification App](https://github.com/NasriLadaa/Nasri_Sameer_Thesis_SWEN860)**: This .NET Framework project, integrated with SQL Server, includes an imported dataset of user reviews collected from various health, finance, sports, and telecommunications apps on Google Play. The application allows users to manually classify, label, and annotate these reviews according to six key non-functional requirements, which were used in my master’s thesis ⬆️ to train models based on the data.
